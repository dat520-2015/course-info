# Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Question:** I completed the lab last year, but want to retake the written exam to improve my grade. Do I have to redo the lab assignments?

   **Answer:** No. Your grade from last year's lab exam will remain intact in the University's grade database.

2. **Question:** I took the lab exam last year, but want to improve my grade. Is this possible?

   **Answer:** Yes it is. But be warned, it is a lot of work, even though you may reuse some of your code from last year's assignments. That is, we are continuously improving the lab assignments, so there is no guarantee that they will remain identical in future years. We will not allow retake of a previous year's lab assignments. This means that you will also have to do the new assignments, if they differ from last year's assignments. Thus, putting in the extra effort the first year is highly recommended to avoid this!!

3. **Question:** (continuing on Question 2): Can I skip the first two lab assignments since I passed last year?

   **Answer:** Yes. But we recommend doing the new assignments since it will help you repeat some of the Golang stuff and they will also be more relevant to the remaining lab assignments this year. To retake the lab, you must redo the last four assignments.

4. **Question:** (continuing on Question 2): I don't want to rewrite and submit the written reports for lab3-6; is that ok?

   **Answer:** No. You may glean content from last year's reports, but keep in mind that some of the assignments may have changed. 

5. **Question:** I have a random question about how to do XYZ with the `git` command, can I ask you such a question?

   **Answer:** Of course you can. I know you have a lot of stuff to read in this and other courses, but I highly recommend reading the first two chapters of the [Git Pro book](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2). It covers the basic things you need in this course. The rest will be explained in the lab assignments.

6. **Question:** The Autograder is down or behaving in an unexpected manner, i.e. I think I found a bug or want to suggest an improvement; what can I do?

   **Answer:** Report it to us in this [form](http://goo.gl/forms/lnBhJdsyz6). 

7. **Question:** I want to work on my own computer for the lab assignments. Is this possible?

   **Answer:** Yes, but there is a big but here. We cannot offer technical support for a wide variety of operating systems and configurations. So, while we encourage that you try this, you are on your own if we cannot help; we primarily offer support for the machines in the Linux lab. If you have little experience with Linux from before, take this opportunity to learn even more new stuff ;-)

If you have any questions, please try to find the answers in the available course material before emailing me. If you have any other questions, concerns or suggestions for improvements, I'm happy to hear from you by email or in-person in class or the lab.
